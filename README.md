易曰：亢龙有悔，此话上而不许下，信而不许诎，往而不许自返者也，意为居上位的人要戒骄，要不会因波折尔后悔，进退维谷，后也刻画傲慢者难免招祸。人生谢世，痛快时莫忘回顾，发端处当留余步，不要太探求完备，逼近极点的功夫要有所选择。要不否极泰来，会带来恶毒。明人洪应明的《菜根谭》有云：喝酒莫教成醉醺醺，看花慎勿至离披。凡事只达七八分处才有佳趣，待到花开，便是花谢待到月圆，便是月缺，这个原因放在即日仍旧有很强的模仿意旨，犯得着咱们细细品咂的。
　　但是，岁月的流转之中，风雨始终在不动声色的洗刷着原本就已经非常残破的泥墙，它们迟早会在村子里消失，并会被村里人在原址上建起崭新的建筑，过着越来越富足的生活。那么，等到那些残墙也消失了的时候，我们再回到村子里去，在村道上遇到的那些人，谁来告诉他们，我们是什么人，到村子里去做什么？
Year-end 1979, pingxiang train station opened, never muddy one-track leap broaden the "first" for the ping city road, just a few short years, road on both sides run, mountain port after two village, then slowly, and I think that soon fell in love with the "road".
Remember back near the solar terms a year, came on the market calamus, Xiao Yi and reed leaves, then grandma let my mother buy some paper, cut into narrow strip, fold into his finger gold pieces the size of the diamond objects;
Made one color photograph wrapped yarn, exquisite colorful reed, then linking into four or five strings with a thread of silk, hanging on the hook, is very good.
One to the Dragon Boat Festival in the morning, mother will wear for me, and two series of colorful reed hung on my two small plait, pinch the ends of the earth I embarrassed, reluctantly.
The grandmother would say: "wearing today, a year is not sick."
When my little students with envy my eye wear, I began to satisfied, the teacher saw also asked appreciates.
I'm flattered.
Feel the class only a few people wearing this beautiful holiday, and I put the most beautiful and fun.
Decades later, in a long time, my memory of the Dragon Boat Festival, my memories of grandma and miss, always together with these details trifles.
At that time, I the hazy childishness always want to ask what comes next: why do you want to wear it?
From what when begin?
Grandma's answer, of course, never meet my request.
One end is more than this, even the doors and Windows on both sides hanging calamus and moxa leaf function, significance and the reason I want to ask a clear, adult's answer, of course, also never satisfy me.
